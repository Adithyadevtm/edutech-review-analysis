One of my biggest struggles was debugging errors—I used to spend hours frustrated over a single mistake. But at Techolas, I learned how to break down problems step by step. I still remember the day I finally fixed a tricky bug in my project. Instead of just giving me the answer, my mentor guided me through it, and that moment changed the way I approached coding. As the course went on, I gained confidence, built projects I was proud of, and even started helping others in my batch. The best part? With their placement assistance, I landed my first job in tech!

Avodha,Pranav s,1,"Disappointed with the MERN Stack Course at Avada. I enrolled in Avada hoping to gain strong, up-to-date knowledge in MERN Stack development. Unfortunately, the experience has been very disappointing. The course content is extremely outdated — they still teach EJS in 2025, which has very limited relevance in today's job market.
They did not cover essential topics like Redux, and the MERN stack projects provided are extremely basic and outdated, offering little to no real-world value. There was no proper integration between ReactJS and NodeJS, which defeats the purpose of a full-stack course. Moreover, the coding quality is poor, and many assignments lack relevance or practical depth. If you're serious about landing a job in web development, I strongly suggest looking for better institutes. Avada, unfortunately, does not meet the industry standards or expectations.
